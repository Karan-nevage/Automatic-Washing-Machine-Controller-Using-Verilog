# Automatic-Washing-Machine-Controller-Using-Verilog
This repository features a Verilog finite state machine (FSM) to control an automatic washing machine, simulating states like door check, water fill, detergent add, wash, drain, and spin. A comprehensive testbench verifies diverse scenarios, including errors and edge cases, with VCD waveform generation for debugging and analysis.
